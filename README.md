Oh man, just finished watching Nonnas and my brain is kinda buzzing, ya know what I mean? Like, the whole thing was such a rollercoaster. Itâ€™s like, you're just sitting there, wrapped in this cozy Italian hug, and the next thing you know you're plunged into, like, deep grandma wisdom.

Seriously, the way they talk about life and food is insane. And their personalities just shine through. Itâ€™s kinda like a warm soup for the soul I didnâ€™t know I needed. But geez, did it make me hungry. I was literally about to download the movieâ€™s recipes or something.

And can we talk about the scenery for a sec? Ugh, Italy is like this dreamland Iâ€™ll never get tired of. The vineyards, the sun-soaked patios, and all that. It almost makes you forget how badly the world is burning right now. I mean, we watch the movie, try to escape, right?

> Speaking of escaping, there was this one moment where this Nonna was just ranting about life, and it felt like she was saying something I really needed to hearâ€”though I have no clue what it was anymore. My brainâ€™s all over the place. Classic me. ðŸ˜‚

Anyway, I need to chill but also maybe make some pasta? Or at least try to, before burning down the kitchen. And I love how every nonna had their thing with oh, this is the secret ingredientâ€”but they ALL said it, like come on, they canâ€™t all have the magical secret, can they?

Dude, why did I just type code? I should head to bed. The movie was good, but a nap sounds even better right now. ðŸ’¤
